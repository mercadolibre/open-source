*"I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things"* - Linus Torvalds

Welcome! This repository serves as a guide to Open Source at Mercado Libre. Here you will find information about our Open Source Program Office (OSPO), and our approach to Open Source.

## What is Open Source for us?

**Open Source = Legal Framework + Method of Production + Social Arrangement**

In terms of technology, open-source is the best way to create software because it speeds up product feedback, drives adoption, and improves the reliability of the product that we are building. From the business side, business innovation leads to larger communities spurring more tech innovation and that leads to increased incentives for open-source, closing a virtuous cycle.


## Our Approach

At Mercado Libre, we believe that Open Source is essential for technological progress and building a strong developer community. Our objectives are to:

- **Adopt**: Integrate Open Source technologies into our projects and products whenever possible to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.
- **Collaborate**: Work together with Open Source communities to improve software quality, share knowledge, and foster innovations.


## Open Source Program Office (OSPO)

The Open Source Program Office (OSPO) at Mercado Libre is responsible for managing our Open Source initiatives. Our OSPO focuses on:

- **Promoting**: Encouraging the conscious use to Open Source projects within our organization.
- **Managing**: Overseeing the policies and practices related to Open Source to ensure we follow industry best practices.
- **Supporting**: Assisting teams wishing to make contributions to Open Source projects or develop new ones.
